    <h4>Example summary (1st chapter)</h4>
    <p id="summary">' Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No. 7, Saville Row, Burlington, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814 . He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention . People said that he resembled Byron--at least that his head was Byronic .  Phileas Fogg lived alone in Saville Row, London, with a single domestic . He breakfasted and dined at the club, at hourshematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table . He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four hours in the house, either in sleeping or making his toilet .  Phileas Fogg was awaiting his successor, James Forster, who was due at the house between 11 and half-past . Fogg dismissed Forster because Forster had brought shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of around 80-six degrees Fahrenheit . A young man of thirty advanced and bowed to Fogg, Jean Passepartout, a French valet . Mr. Fogg said: "I\'ve had several trades. I\'ve been an Itinerant singer, a circus-rider, a professor ofgymnastics"'</p>
